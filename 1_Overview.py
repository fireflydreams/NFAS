            competing locally, before progressing to national competitions (the 3Ds and the National Champs.) Having
            found there is a lot of data on the society site showing the history of the results, I decided to 
            investigate the history of the scores and look for any trends.""")

            all under x age classes) have been removed. This i due to the wildly varying results that were seen on 
            these, and the under subscription to them.""")
